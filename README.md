# duckyduino
✔ Turn your Arduino into a kind of Rubber Ducky to run commands and scripts on a Windows machine.

💲 For example if you edit the arduino code on line 66 putting "powershell" instead of cmd and on line 69 editing the message "echo Hello world" to the code you want, you can inject this code: https://github.com/BlackShell256/powershell-reverse-shell from powershell to gain a shell without being discovered by Windows Defender.

❗ It is under your responsibility the use that you can give him.
